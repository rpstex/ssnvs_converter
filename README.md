# ssnvs_converter
The SSA allows businesses to verify if SSNs are legitimate (for tax purposes on current employees only). There are two ways to provide SSNs to be verified by the SSA on their website: 1) manually enter up to 10 at a time 2) upload a 'flat' text file in a specific format with up to 250,000 SSNs. The format of the file is very specific and so this tool aims to help business users get the data into the required format for bulk verification.
